About 42 million women in the entire world with unintended pregnancies choose abortion.

It\"s not their fault people made mistakes and now they\"re the ones having to pay for it. Abortion should be illegal because abortions are not safe, laws are protecting unborn babies, and fetuses can feel pain. Abortion should have never been legal."

But not abortion, it's an ending life that should be illegal. If your not ready to have a child and you get pregnant abortion isn't an answer. Getting an abortion is periodically wrong and no women should even think of it. Even if they have to carry the baby for 9 months. As I stated before abortion is a big deal, it can cause serious psychological impairment to the woman in the form of depression an guilt. And the mothers life in danger doesn't always have to have a reason to have an abortion she might just have a miscarriage in the early period which could lead to having an abortion but that didn't mean she wanted that to happen, things can go right and wrong. Choosing adoption as an alternative to abortion would give the baby it's right to live. When the fetus is aborted it is skilled it has the same status as with respect to what is important. The most important argument against abortion would be- can we choose to kill unwanted pregnancies? Should a person be so irresponsible to land up in a situation where they have to be merciless to the unborn? P1:: It is always wrong to kill an innocent person. P2: the fetus is an innocent person. P3:: Abortion kills fetuses. ::< therefore abortion is morally wrong. *the fetus is a person because there is no way to determine that it is not a person."

    "sentences": "Thank you, Pro. Negative Case A1: False equivalence In the first round, in order to clarify the single word \"abortion\" into a resolution, my opponent elaborates: \"if abortion is murder, so is abstinence. Having an abortion is the equivalent of not getting pregnant in the first place\". Now, there is are obvious differences between abortion and not getting pregnant. I. There is no child in not getting pregnant, yet there is a child involved with an abortion. II. There is no child death involved in not getting pregnant, yet there is always child death with abortion. It follows that \"having an abortion is the equivalent of not getting pregnant in the first place\" is contradictory. Hence, my opponent's resolution falls under the logical fallacy classification of false equivalence [1]. Counter-arguments \"Note: My firs round was not meant to be taken literally, I just thought it did a fairly good job of summing up my point. A fetus in the first few months is not mentally developed, and to abort it is the equivalent of not getting pregnant in the first place. I am not debating at what point it is developed; it is a gray area.\" My opponent has attempted to shift the goalposts here, which is logically fallacious [2]. How this occurred is that opponent originally clarified the resolution to be about a debate on \"having an abortion is the equivalen[ce] of not getting pregnant in the first place\", but now he/she has lessened this burden of proof by claiming that the resolution had to be taken non-literally. Unfortunately for my opponent, no such further clarification was presented in the first round: \"If abortion is murder, so is abstinence. Having an abortion is the equivalent of not getting pregnant in the first place.\" Within these two sentences, you will find nothing that dictates this debate requires a non-literal interpretation of the resolution. Therefore, the resolution is not set to be taken non-literally, and thus my interpretation remains legitimate in this debate. \"The last two months is not okay to abort, first three months it is. The middle is fairly circumstantial. I am arguing for the right to have an abortion, not whether it is ok to abort a seven month developed child. This post was more of an introductory round, not a main argument.\" My opponent concedes the debate with this argument, even if the resolution were to be taken non-literally. You see, my opponent argues that abortion is not a singular colour, in regards to metaphysical ethics/morals (i.e. not being \"okay\" to abort during the last two months). In other words, it would be okay to abort in the first three months, BUT abortion, according to Pro, is the same as not getting pregnant! What this means is that: 1) Abortion is proposed as a singular type 2) However, according to my opponent, there is a difference in the morality/ethics of abortion, varying based on the time of incubation (meaning that there are two types of abortion) 3) Not getting pregnant is a singular type 4) My opponent judged that abortion is (ethically/morally) the equivalent not getting pregnant in the first place, despite there being black-and-white differences (i.e. singular term) in regards to the abortion in question C) Therefore, my opponent has to keep the morality/ethics of abortion either wrong or \"okay\" (due to the construction of the resolution requiring abortion to equal not getting pregnant), yet my opponent has argued that the ethics/morality of abortion varies! Thus, abortion is not always the equivalent of not getting pregnant. Conclusion Via a legitimate interpretation of the resolution, I have shown that there are literal differences between abortion and not getting pregnant, thereby negating the resolution. Later, even though I am not required to do so, I showed how my opponent's argument concedes the debate, even if I were to allow the shifting of goalposts to a strictly non-literal interpretation. On both grounds, the resolution is negated. References [1] [2]"

    "sentences": "Abortion is the ending of pregnancy by the removal or forcing out from the womb of a fetus or embryo before it is able to survive on its own. An abortion can occur spontaneously, in which case it is often called a miscarriage. It can also be purposely caused in which case it is known as an induced abortion. The term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy. The similar procedure after the fetus may be able to survive on its own is medically known as a late termination of pregnancy. There are two kinds of abortion in the U.S. \" in-clinic abortion and the abortion pill. Abortions are very common. In fact, 3 out of 10 women in the U.S. have an abortion by the time they are 45 years old. If you are pregnant, you have options. If you are trying to decide if abortion is the right choice for you, you probably have many things to think about. Learning the facts about abortion may help you in making your decision. You may also want to learn more about parenting and adoption. If you are under 18, your state may require one or both of your parents to give permission for your abortion or be told of your decision prior to the abortion. However, in most states you can ask a judge to excuse you from these requirements. Learn more about parental consent for abortion. Only you can decide what is best for you. But we are here to help. A staff member at your local Planned Parenthood health center can discuss abortion and all of your options with you and help you find the services you need. The debate over whether or not abortion should be a legal option continues to divide Americans. The abortion debate is the ongoing controversy surrounding the moral and legal status of abortion. The two main groups involved in the abortion debate are the self-described \"pro-choice\" movement (emphasizing the right of women to choose whether to abort a pregnancy or to grow it to term) and the self-described \"pro-life\" movement (emphasizing the right of the embryo or fetus to gestate and be born). Both of these ascriptions are considered loaded terms in mainstream media where terms such as \"abortion rights\" or \"anti-abortion\" are generally preferred. Each movement has, with varying results, sought to influence public opinion and to attain legal support for its position, with small numbers of anti-abortion advocates sometimes using violence. I believe a women should be able to decide, without consequences, whether to end the life of their unborn child or proceed with motherhood."
